# food-finder
A web-app that gives users suggestions for dishes, then finds and saves recipes for dishes that the user "swipes right" on.

## To install packages and run:
1. ```npm install```  
2. ```npm start```

## To do:
- connect database (mysql, postgres, mongo?)
- figure out how we want to save/display the recipes per user
- animations for swiping
